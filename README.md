Akatsuki Resources is the name of this project, the name comes from a personal favourite gang in the popular anime series, Naruto. This project is basically the backend development of my eCommerce website which i employed the use of Java Springboot framework. The project includes creating users that will be accessing an eCommerce online store that sells and allow users to buy and sell personal gaming accessories. The users will be able to create accounts, browse categories, create products for sale and add prices with descriptions, and finally purchase products that are avaliable for purchase. 

The products have categories that they all belong to. Think of the categories like genres in music, they include:
Gaming furnitures
Consoles
Controllers
Headsets
Monitors
Keyboards

This project has a frontend aspect which communicates with the backend and they were both hosted on MsAzure and Netlify. This project simply employs the use of springboot documentation to create necessary classes, controllers and handlers to create the functionalities above.
